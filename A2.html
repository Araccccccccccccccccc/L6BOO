        <p>A container-fluid is a full-width container that spans the entire width of the viewport. It is used when you want your
        content to take up the maximum available width, regardless of the screen size. The .container-fluid class is particularly
        useful for creating layouts that need to adapt seamlessly to different devices, such as dashboards or data-heavy pages.
        Unlike the .container class, which has fixed widths at various breakpoints, .container-fluid always remains 100% wide.
        This makes it ideal for designs that require edge-to-edge content presentation. Just like .container, it is typically
        used as the outermost element in the body to hold rows and columns of the grid system.</p>

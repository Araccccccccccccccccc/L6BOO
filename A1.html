        <p>A container is a fundamental layout element used to wrap website content and provide proper alignment and spacing. It
        helps maintain a consistent structure across different screen sizes. There are two main types of containers in Bootstrap
        — .container and .container-fluid. The .container class provides a fixed-width layout that changes its width depending
        on the screen size (responsive), while .container-fluid spans the entire width of the viewport, making it 100% wide at
        all times. Containers are usually the first element inside the
        
        <body> tag and are used to hold rows and columns that make up the grid system. </p>
